**A practical guide to getting the most out of Excel, using it for data preparation, applying machine learning models (including cloud services) and understanding the outcome of the data analysis.**

## What is this book about?
We have made huge progress in teaching computers to perform difficult tasks, especially those that are repetitive and time-consuming for humans. Excel users, of all levels, can feel left behind by this innovation wave. The truth is that a large amount of the work needed to develop and use a machine learning model can be done in Excel.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Use Excel to preview and cleanse datasets 
* Understand correlations between variables and optimize the input to machine learning models 
* Use and evaluate different machine learning models from Excel 
* Understand the use of different visualizations 
* Learn the basic concepts and calculations to understand how artificial neural networks work
